singapore: hungry diners continued to throng mr ong eng koon's popular chicken rice stall at pek kio market and food centre on wednesday jun 1 the first day of a ban on malaysian chicken exports
but like several other food businesses that cna spoke too there is uncertainty over supply and cost issues
mr ong said he received his usual supply of fresh chicken but is unsure when this will end at the same hawker centre another chicken rice seller mr patrick ng said he expects to continue getting fresh chicken for two more weeks 
monga taiwanese fried chicken a fried chicken chain in singapore has locked down a supply of fresh poultry for 10 days the duration given by suppliers to mr lem cheong director of operations at baoshi f&b management the parent company of monga
on may 23 malaysian prime minister ismail sabri yaakob announced he would halt the export of up to 36 million chickens per month from jun 1 to address a domestic supply shortage
fresh and fresh-frozen chicken
for one singapore importer it went right down to the wire mr ma chin chew chief executive of hup heng poultry industries said his firm imported one last batch of fresh chicken - at 1159pm on tuesday night - just before the ban kicked in
when asked about supplies of fresh chicken in the coming days he said some importers may have stocked up in the past week 
these chickens will be fresh-frozen rather than fresh said mr ma who is also the secretary of singapore's poultry merchants' association 
this one week they've suppliers gotten more and frozen it we call this fresh-frozen because it's frozen for less than a week it can be used as fresh for the next one two weeks it can be used 
with no incoming live poultry mr ma's company will stop slaughtering operations for now and consider processing frozen chicken - cutting it up into parts - if there is demand
the frozen alternative
while some food businesses are already planning to switch to frozen chicken others are taking a wait-and-see approach 
at monga deep-frozen brazilian chicken is currently being considered as an alternative to the malaysian fresh poultry the outlets use mr cheong said 
for mr ong the chicken rice vendor it is simply not an option the taste is different he said 
while his stall offers other dishes like duck and char siew rice his mainstay - chicken rice - is a crowd-puller and accounts for most of his business 
even at the tail end of the lunch peak there were customers waiting to order the dish which he sells at s$3 a plate 
mr ong who has been selling chicken rice for 25 years said he plans to stick to this price despite the rising cost of poultry 
like buying stocks
a few days ago his supplier raised the cost of one kg of chicken from s$5 plus to s$6 plus even so mr ong said he would still make a little bit of profit without having to increase the price of his chicken rice
mr ng the other chicken rice vendor at pek kio market lamented the cost increase he used to pay s$430 per kg of chicken it now costs him around s$6 
and there appears to be no end in sight 
the prices have increased twice so far and weâ€™re expecting a third time in the next few days said mr cheong of monga fried chicken
when the malaysia export ban was announced prices went up by s$050 per kg and then another s$030 a few days ago mr cheong said the price of special cuts like thigh and breast increased by s$120 per kg
prices are rocketing for fresh chicken buying chicken is like buying stocks now
