the federal liberals have more than $85 billion in new spending room from a booming economic rebound and plan to spend some of the windfall on a series of measures aimed at keeping the good growth going
 
the 2022 budget released thursday includes more than $31 billion in net new spending over the next five years
it’s targeted at speeding the flow of goods through the country’s supply chains boosting housing supply and jolting businesses out of an anemic period of investment
the new spending has increased the fiscal year’s deficit to $528 billion from earlier estimates of $441 billion
government officials framed the spending as a hedge against near-term economic uncertainty created by russia’s unprovoked invasion of ukraine and the sixth wave of the covid-19 pandemic
but the liberals also say the spending is aimed at the long-term as well to address structural issues within the national economy that could hold back growth in the long-term
it’s why the government is reprofiling $15 billion in existing spending for a new fund designed to lower business investment risk for research and new technologies $38 billion over eight years for a critical minerals strategy and $450 million over five years to unclog supply chains
the document also commits to spending money from budgets past by forcing provinces to allocate nearly $73 billion in outstanding infrastructure dollars by next march or risk losing the money timelines to spend the money have also been pushed back from 2027 to 2033
overall the budget points to a government admitting there are hurdles to canada’s long-term growth prospects though falls short of a detailed economic strategy said robert asselin senior vice-president policy with the business council of canada
the budget forecasts 39 per cent economic growth this year but expects that to slow over the ensuing four years to average 29 per cent annual growth in real gross domestic product inflation too is expected to fall from 39 per cent this year an upward revision to december’s fiscal update before starting next year to fall toward the bank of canada’s target of two per cent
unemployment is expected to stay at a low of 55 per cent over the forecast horizon
economist armine yalnizyan an atkinson fellow on the future of workers said the budget was a missed opportunity invest in health-care workers _ for example to keep workers from leaving the care economy that accounts for one-fifth of gdp and which other workers rely on
total spending is this fiscal year will decline to $4523 billion including debt servicing costs from the $4979 billion in the preceding 12-month period as emergency pandemic aid measures end
even with the emergency spending the budget forecasts the debt as a percentage of the economy will hit 451 per cent this year and decline over the coming years including in a worst-case scenario envisioned in the document
randall bartlett senior director of canadian economics at desjardins said the government has put some of its financial windfall into the bank for a rainy day given the uncertain environment and held back on moving ahead with a handful of election promises in this budget
to pay for some of the new spending the government is rolling out a tax on excess profits at banks and insurance companies that the finance department expects to reel in $61 billion over five years there is also a warning shot to the country’s top earners that the government plans to change their minimum tax with details later this year
the liberals are also promising a spending review to find $6 billion in savings over five years a progress report is promised for next year’s budget
ndp leader jagmeet singh said thursday that his caucus will support the 2022 federal budget
singh says the budget introduced by freeland honours the agreement he made last month to support the liberals on key votes like budgets in return for the government moving on ndp priorities in health care housing and reconciliation
the new democrats had been confident there would be no surprises in the federal budget and that the liberals would honour spending pledges made in their confidence and supply pact
daniel blaikie the ndp finance critic had earlier said the budget is the first test of the agreement and the ndp would be watching closely to see if the liberals deliver on their promises
the ndp agreed to prop up the minority liberal government until 2025 including voting for its budget so it passes through the commons
in return for support on the budget and confidence motions it secured a string of policy pledges from the liberals many of which needed funding this year
